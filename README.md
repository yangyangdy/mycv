Rip-off of [Alex Chi Zhang (cxs/skyzh)](https://github.com/skyzh)'s
[CV](https://skyzh.github.io/files/cv.pdf) as a LaTeX template called `chicv`.

Suggestions and PRs are welcome. Honestly, I'm not a master in LaTeX.

照着迟先生的简历扒的模板。祝大家都能成功得令人震惊。

Note to `chi-cv-template` users: according to [Chi's twitter](https://twitter.com/iskyzh/status/1639139679235633153),
 he's planning to switch to a new typesetting app: [typst](https://typst.app/),
 which is also recommended by several of my friends.
 It's currently (as of March 2023) in beta, but it's worth a try.
